(** {1 Core language}

    The representation of the core language is {i not} exposed. Instead, an
    abstract type is provided of both core language types and core language
    terms. Both terms and types support silent weakening: hence an element of
    {!tp} or {!tm} can be used in any scope.

  (** {1 Rule types}

      The refiner follows a version of the bidirectional typing discipline,
      dividing proofs into {!chk_rule} and {!syn_rule}. The purpose of the bidirectional
      division of labor is to enable many steps of refinement that would
      otherwise induce dozens of conversion checks to be collated in such a way
      that only one conversion check is required.

      A related side-effect is that the refinement scripts contain very few
      annotations, drawing annotations inward from the goal and outward from
      the context.
